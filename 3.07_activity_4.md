# 3.07 Activity 4

Make a copy of the `Lesson3.ipynb` notebook and name it `Activity_4.ipynb`. Go to the cell with the following code:

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=100)
```

and set the option `random_state` to any other integer value of your choice with up to three digits.

Now, in the notebook rename the model name to `logistic_model_new.pkl` and run again the notebook and get the new predictions

Are the resulting predictions the same?
